# Plastic-Injection-Fault-Detection-System

## Overview
This system is designed to provide a user-friendly graphical interface that indicates potential failures in a plastic injection system. By leveraging machine sensors, real-time data is collected and displayed, enabling early detection of possible failures. This proactive approach helps prevent production downtime and machine breakdowns. This project was developed by Josue Noel Lopez Guevara @tintays and Manuel Alejandro Juarez Juarez, both students from Universidad Tecnologica La Salle (La Salle Technological University), Leon, Nicaragua.

## Features
- User-friendly graphical interface for easy monitoring.
- Real-time data collection and analysis from machine sensors.
- Early warning system to alert operators of impending failures.
- Simulation mode using input values to mimic sensor data.
- Integration of "py-script" framework to run Python within HTML.
- Implementation of an AI component trained on ".csv" file data.

## Simulation Mode
To facilitate testing and development without actual sensors, the system offers a simulation mode. This mode utilizes input values to emulate the data that real sensors would provide. This is useful for fine-tuning the system's performance and understanding its behavior under different scenarios.

## AI Integration
An AI component is integrated into the system, enhancing its fault detection capabilities. The AI is trained on data from ".csv" files, enabling it to recognize patterns and anomalies. This further contributes to the system's ability to predict and prevent failures.
